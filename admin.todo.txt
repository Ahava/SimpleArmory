admin for mounts:
 [x] drag/drop global support
 [x] hide wowhead popover when dragging
 [x] drag/drop to category
  [x] removes from source list
  [x] formulates proper object and saves to cat
 [x] call get mounts for blizzard
 [x] compare to current mounts list
 [x] show all new mounts in UI
 [ ] probably need a mount order admin section
 [ ] bug: when adding a category if you cancel it shows up as null
 [ ] hookup notify dialog
 
 [ ] change select to Mounts from Blizzard API (should support mounts from game api later)
 
 later:
 [ ] fix lint errors
 [ ] dynamic script load so it only loads when you go to /admin
 [ ] reorganize like I had with c# app
