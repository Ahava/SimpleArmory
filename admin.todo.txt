[ ] ui to select what to update
  [ ] start with a dropdown

[ ] only show save button once a change was made to something
[ ] download attribute on link is dynamic based on what I'm editing
[ ] page styling
    [ ] save button goes right side

[ ] how generic do I need this to be? should I just have super specialized admin sections?

create new categories
 [x] mount 
    [x] save to json, to replace it
    [x] add
    [x] reorder
    
admin for mounts
 [ ] call get mounts for blizzard
 [ ] compare to current mounts list
 [ ] show all new mounts in UI
 [ ] drag/drop to category
 
 later:
 [ ] dynamic script load so it only loads when you go to /admin
 [ ] reorganize like I had with c# app
