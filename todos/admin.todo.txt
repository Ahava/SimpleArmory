 -----------
[x] bug: when adding a category if you cancel it shows up as null
[x] style button buttons
[x] ui to select what to update
  [x] start with a dropdown
  [x] up top: Admin: <select>
[x] hookup subcat buttons
[x] only show save button once a change was made to something
[x] download attribute on link is dynamic based on what I'm editing

[x] create new categories
 [x] mount 
    [x] save to json, to replace it
    [x] add
    [x] reorder
[x] page styling
    [x] save button goes right side

admin for mounts:
 [x] drag/drop global support
 [x] hide wowhead popover when dragging
 [x] drag/drop to category
  [x] removes from source list
  [x] formulates proper object and saves to cat
 [x] call get mounts for blizzard
 [x] compare to current mounts list

[x] add 3rd column in category to allow item reordering
[x] add 7.3 mounts
[x] unify category admin 
[-] add names to all the things so reordering is easier.  determine size impact first.  is the url trick in item good enough?
